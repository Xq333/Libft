# Libft Project README

## Overview

The **Libft** project is an essential part of my education at 42 school. In this project, I created my own library of fundamental C programming functions, which are equivalent to those found in the C Standard Library. These functions cover various operations like string manipulation, memory management, and other common tasks in the C programming language.

## What I Learned

While working on the **Libft** project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills, including:

1. **Core Programming Skills:** I deepened my understanding of fundamental programming concepts and the C language itself. Implementing these functions from scratch provided hands-on experience with key programming concepts.

2. **Problem-Solving:** This project honed my problem-solving skills as I tackled the challenge of creating these functions to meet specified requirements.

3. **Independence:** I became more self-reliant as I had to develop these functions without relying on pre-existing libraries. This taught me to be resourceful and inventive in my coding.

4. **Foundation for Future Projects:** **Libft** serves as a strong foundation for more advanced projects and challenges at 42. The skills and knowledge gained from this project are indispensable for a successful journey as a software developer.

## Project Structure

The **Libft** project typically includes a library of C functions (e.g., `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_memset`, etc.) and a `Makefile` for compiling the library. You may also have a set of test cases to verify the correctness of your functions.

## Usage

You can use the functions from the **Libft** library in your C programs by including the library in your compilation process. Here's an example of how to compile a program using **Libft**:

```shell
make
```
## Credits

This project was completed as part of my 42 school curriculum.
